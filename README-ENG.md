## And now the most interesting))
### How does the program work?
Since you can‚Äôt just put an animated gif on an avatar in Zoom, this program breaks it into frames and puts them on your profile picture in turn

### Limitations:
#### Works best with square gifs. You can trim here https://ezgif.com/crop
#### In the same place, you can delete unnecessary frames, I advise you to do this

#### The avatar update interval in the zoom client is about 1 second, which means that if the number of frames in your GIF is 50, it will take about a minute to fully play it. The standards of gifs are in the examples / folder
#### It is necessary to select a delay somewhere from 0.5 to 1 second.
##### Delay matching algorithm:
##### If there is a frame skip - increase
##### Reduce if necessary - reduce
To change the delay during program execution:
- press Ctrl + C
- enter 4

### Does not work
   - Update the program
   - Delete "accounts.zoomgtadonotopenverysecret"
   - Check that the information used to log in is correct.
   - Check again.
   - If you want to use the gif from examples, then you need to not just write the name of the gif, but the full path to it
  ```sh
  Enter the name of a .gif:
  examples/loli
  ```
   - Drop the log into the telegram channel https://t.me/zoomgta

### UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 16-19
   - Use CMD, not Git Bash

### Problem with colors / inverted colors

   - Download the problematic gif
   - In the "Optimization method" select "Optimize Transparency" and twist the slider to 0. Also, you can try "Coalesce"
